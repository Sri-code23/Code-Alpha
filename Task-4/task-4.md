Here’s a **detailed, step-by-step process** for automating the sorting of emails into labels using **IMAP** and **Gmail API**.

### **Step 1: Set Up Gmail API Access**

Before you begin, you need to set up access to the Gmail API. This allows your Python script to interact with your Gmail inbox programmatically.

#### 1.1 Enable Gmail API
- **Go to the Google Developer Console**: Visit the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
- **Create a Project**: Click on "Create Project" and give it a name (e.g., "Email Automation").
- **Enable Gmail API**: Search for **Gmail API** and click "Enable".
  
#### 1.2 Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
- **Go to the Credentials tab** in the Google Developer Console.
- Click on **Create Credentials** > **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**.
- Set the application type to **Web Application** or **Other**.
- Download the **credentials.json** file and save it in your project folder.

#### 1.3 Install Required Python Libraries
You will need to install the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

---

### **Step 2: Set Up Authentication**

You need to authenticate your Gmail account using OAuth2 to allow your script to access Gmail on your behalf.

#### 2.1 Create an Authentication Function
Here’s how you can authenticate using OAuth2.

```python
import os
import pickle
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

# Gmail API Scopes for read and modify access
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify']

def authenticate_gmail_api():
    """Authenticate and create the Gmail API client."""
    creds = None
    # Check if token.pickle exists to avoid re-authentication
    if os.path.exists('token.pickle'):
        with open('token.pickle', 'rb') as token:
            creds = pickle.load(token)
    
    # If no valid credentials, request the user to authenticate
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
                'credentials.json', SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)

        # Save credentials for the next run
        with open('token.pickle', 'wb') as token:
            pickle.dump(creds, token)
    
    # Build the Gmail service client
    return build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)
```

#### 2.2 Token Persistence
The `token.pickle` file saves the user's credentials. This file allows you to skip the authentication process in subsequent runs.

---

### **Step 3: Fetch Emails from Gmail**

The next step is to retrieve unread emails from your Gmail inbox using the **Gmail API**.

#### 3.1 Fetch Unread Emails
Use the `users().messages().list` method to get the unread emails from the inbox.

```python
def get_unread_emails(service):
    """Get unread emails from the inbox."""
    try:
        results = service.users().messages().list(userId='me', labelIds=['INBOX'], q="is:unread").execute()
        messages = results.get('messages', [])

        if not messages:
            print('No unread messages.')
            return []
        
        return [message['id'] for message in messages]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching emails: {e}")
        return []
```

- **`labelIds=['INBOX']`**: Filters emails to only those in the inbox.
- **`q="is:unread"`**: Filters only unread emails.

---

### **Step 4: Process and Apply Labels**

Once the unread emails are fetched, you need to process them and apply labels based on certain conditions (such as subject or sender).

#### 4.1 Apply Labels to Emails
The Gmail API allows you to apply labels to emails, but you need to know the **label ID**. You can create custom labels in Gmail and fetch their IDs via the API or manually.

```python
def apply_label(service, email_id, label_id):
    """Apply a label to an email."""
    try:
        msg = service.users().messages().modify(userId='me', id=email_id, body={'addLabelIds': [label_id]}).execute()
        print(f"Email ID {email_id} labeled successfully.")
        return msg
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error applying label: {e}")
```

You can replace `label_id` with the ID of the label you want to apply (e.g., “Important”).

#### 4.2 Extract Email Details
To apply conditions (such as applying a label based on the subject or sender), you need to extract email details using the `users().messages().get` method.

```python
def get_email_details(service, email_id):
    """Get email details such as subject and sender."""
    try:
        msg = service.users().messages().get(userId='me', id=email_id).execute()
        headers = msg['payload']['headers']

        subject = next(header['value'] for header in headers if header['name'] == 'Subject')
        sender = next(header['value'] for header in headers if header['name'] == 'From')

        return subject, sender
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error getting email details: {e}")
        return None, None
```

#### 4.3 Define Labeling Logic
Here, you can set the conditions for labeling emails based on subject or sender.

```python
def apply_labels_based_on_conditions(service, email_ids):
    """Apply labels to emails based on conditions."""
    for email_id in email_ids:
        subject, sender = get_email_details(service, email_id)
        
        print(f"Subject: {subject}, Sender: {sender}")

        if 'Important' in subject:  # Check subject for keyword
            important_label_id = 'Label_123456'  # Replace with actual label ID
            apply_label(service, email_id, important_label_id)

        if 'boss@example.com' in sender:  # Check sender email
            boss_label_id = 'Label_654321'  # Replace with actual label ID
            apply_label(service, email_id, boss_label_id)

        # Mark the email as read after processing
        service.users().messages().modify(userId='me', id=email_id, body={'removeLabelIds': ['UNREAD']}).execute()
```

---

### **Step 5: Schedule the Script**

You can schedule this script to run periodically so that it automatically sorts emails as they arrive.

#### 5.1 On Linux/Mac (Using Cron Jobs)
You can set up a cron job to run the script every 10 minutes:
```bash
crontab -e
```
Add this line to your crontab file:
```
*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
```

#### 5.2 On Windows (Using Task Scheduler)
1. Open **Task Scheduler** and create a new task.
2. Set the trigger to run every 10 minutes or based on your preferred interval.
3. Set the action to run the Python script (`python script.py`).

---

### **Step 6: Logging and Error Handling**

It's important to log activities and handle errors gracefully.

#### 6.1 Add Logging
You can use Python’s built-in `logging` module to log the status of emails being processed:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='email_automation.log', level=logging.INFO)

def log_action(action):
    logging.info(f"{action}")
```

#### 6.2 Handle Exceptions
Ensure that your script doesn’t crash and provides meaningful error messages. Use `try-except` blocks around critical code sections.

---

### **Step 7: Optional Enhancements**

1. **Multiple Labels**: You can apply multiple labels to the same email based on different conditions.
2. **Email Responses**: Use **SMTP** to send an automatic response after applying the label.
3. **Custom Labels**: Create custom labels in Gmail through the API.

---

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you can automate the process of sorting emails into labels based on specific conditions such as sender, subject, or keywords. This approach leverages the **Gmail API** for label management and **OAuth2** for secure authentication. Once the script is set up, you can schedule it to run periodically to keep your inbox organized automatically.
